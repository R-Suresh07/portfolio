### Captioning Tamil Videos and Text
[Github Repo](https://github.com/R-Suresh07/Automatic_Captioning_Tamil_Videos_and_Text)

- This project aims to streamline the process of incorporating Tamil subtitles into videos, thereby improving accessibility.
- It operates by accepting a video file and transcribing the spoken content into text using OpenAI’s Whisper transcription model. The text is then translated into Tamil using the Google Translate API. Finally, the Tamil text is superimposed onto the video as subtitles using OpenCV. 
- This project was conceived with the Krishi Vibhag Initiative in mind, enabling Tamil farmers to benefit from government-produced educational videos in their native language.
